# Background images

The background uses **free yam/root vegetable photos** from Pexels (loaded via their CDN). No need to upload any files.

- **Source:** [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/yam/) (free to use, no attribution required).
- If you prefer your own image, place `malanga.png` here and in `src/style.css` change the `.bg-malanga-X` rules back to `background-image: url('/images/malanga.png');`.
